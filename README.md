# Party-People
Party People (PP) is a Musical Information Retrieval (MIR) and Recommendation System. What
started as an exploratory analysis of audio streaming service API's (LastFM, Spotify, etc.) 
developed into a data product that profits entertainment professionals. The R scripts in this repo 
create a genre-based recommendation system (collaborative filtering) and interactive data visualization.
